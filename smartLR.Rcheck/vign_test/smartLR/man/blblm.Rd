\title{estimate the regression with Little Bag of Bootstraps
 It is strongly encouraged to use parallel when m and B is large}
\usage{
blblm(formula, data, m = 10, B = 5000, parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula for the regression}

\item{data}{dataset for the regression}

\item{m}{num of data to split to}

\item{B}{length of Bootstraps}

\item{parallel}{True if to use parallel, True by Default}
}
\description{
But Parallel method often faster than non-Parallel method regardless of m and B
  Since the Author attempts to use Parallel Computing as much places as he can...
